# React + TypeScript + Vite

My React + TypeScript + Vite Project
This is my first project in React + Vite. It is a simple to-do list app that uses Tailwind, Material-tailwind, and AlovaJs for HTTP requests.

Getting Started
To run the project, first install the dependencies:

<code>npm install</code>


Then, start the development server:

<code>npm run dev</code>
